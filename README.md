# Students Adaptation to online learning Data Analysis project. 
## The structure of the code:
   1. Importing the Data
   2. Showcasing the Dataset and its features
   3. Preliminary results & Data preprocessing:
      • Convert categorical variables to numeric:
      • Union of categories
      • Handling null values
   4. Data Analysis:
      • Correlation between the variables of the data-set to the adaptation level
      • Chi-square tests of independence on each pair of relevant features.
      • Hypotheses test for mean diffrences between categories inside relevent variables
      • Relevant graphs for investigate on a high-level the relationship between those
        variables
      • Fitting Classification Tree Model for predicting Students adaptivity Level importing relevant packages    
      • Evaluating the Model
## replicating our analysis end-to-end:
  the source code is orgenaized and commented in the same order of our analysis 
  process,
  running the code chronologically will replicate the analysis.
## Data dependency:
  our code needs only the first data import in the 'Importing the Data' Chunk.
